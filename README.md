# The Comic Con

A game for CSC167

Become a comic book character as you traverse comic panels and manipulate time to escape the bizarre comic world. Complete puzzles and fight enemies, each panel offering a different challenge. Jump from one panel to another, or slide between them to progress through time. Get to the last panel and return to the real world before you are stuck in the comic book forever.
